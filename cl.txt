Admin Dashboard
a new browser interface for School Administrators to view teacher and students activity and usage of our product with ability to filter and aggregate metrics. 
	
Designed a logical data flow from database, app server, and to client that allow high performance and maintainability.

Created a new set of modules to aggregate data from multiple internal and third-party databases and separated the data collection logic from Controller and Model.

Transferred data stored in underutilized third party database service to internal database to reduce operational cost and latency.

Designed and implemented a multi-layer cache system to allow shorter loading time and high filterability of data.

Created dynamic client side script and templates that adapts quickly to changing UI requirements.



Working directly with Product Manager, exchanged ideas on user and buisness needs, intuitive UI/UX, and engineering limitations.

Proposed bi-weekly code review to the engineering team and frequently volunteered to share my work for feedback and knolwdge sharing.

Added a new unit test module that sets up and tear down local test database automatically without changing existing test scripts. Increased test coverage by 10%.
