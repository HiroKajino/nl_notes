Dear InfoFlux Hiring Team

My name is Hiro Kajion, and I would like to be considered for the Enterprise Technical Support Engineer at InfluxData. I am so excited to find a great position where I can combine my engineering experiences, proven communication skills, and crave for learning in a cutting-edge database tech company. 

In my current role as a full stack web developer at NextLesson, an ed-tech company, I design, implement, and maintain our web app features (please see the resume for my full qualifications). I have proven my ability to become productive in unfamiliar code base and frameworks quickly, as well as hunger for new knowledge and opportunities. Having had a previous career as teacher and manager, I feel confortable in speaking about difficult issues in truthfully with empathy and have had success in communication both as technical and non-technical roles. 

I am looking for an opportunity where I can expand my skill sets from exposure to top notch engineering and buisiness practices. 

I am a self-motivated individual looking for a new opportunity to grow and a place to contribute. I would love to have a chance to meet with your team and be considered for employment. 


Thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
