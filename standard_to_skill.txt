Phase 1:
	skills collection created, model class written
	Tag skills modal
	Tagged Skills show in author-view items

	Notes:
		state standards are no longer editable
		Skill tagging is enabled, but it won't change anything in public users' end

	created but still disabled:
		displayed standards are sync'ed with tagged skills' standards
		PublishedGameboard's standards are sync'ed with tagged skills
		Skill Tagger

	No longer necessary:
		Standard routes
		Tag-Standard modal

Schema:
	= Skill(HierarchicalTag)
		{
			id: ObjectId(.....),
			name: 'Phrases',
			parent_id: ...,
			child_ids: [.., ...],
			depth: ...,
			parent_names: [],
			standard_ids : {
				'ccss': [ccss stanards]...,
				'sol' : [standard_ids...], etc...
			}
		}

	= Copies of Skill/Standard info persists in InteractiveResourceUserCopy

		standard_bank = []
		skill_bank = []

		item : {
			{
				skill_ids = [..., ...,],
				excluded_stanard_ids= [...,]
			}
		}
		# try avoiding duplicate standard docs by having a bank of all standards and skills
		# record how much change this brings

		--------
		{
			id: ObjectId(.....),
			name: 'Phrases',
			parent_id: ...,
			depth: ...,
			standard_ids : [array of standard_ids],
			parent_names: ['Grammar', 'Phrases & Punctuation', 'Phrases'] 
			# this takes a long time to calculate unless it's pre-added
			# Avoid having to change previously downloaded lessons. 
			# interactive page should function w/o querrying Skill collection
			
			standards: [<serialized standard doc>, <serialized standard doc>]
			# consider removing unnecessary fields such as description
			
			excluded_standards_ids: []

			focus_skill: True / False # added when it makes it to ref.metadata

		}

		# record how much more space it needs after skills


	= No more mapping from CCSS to state standards, only mapping from skill to standards
		usercopy->sections->columns->items: [
			{
				question_type: ....,
				lexile_levels: ....,

				standards: X
					# a copy of standard doc
				skills: {
					# skill doc + a few added fields 
					...
				} 

			},
			{}...
		]

	= No change to state standards
	= keep mapped_standards but not use it anymore

	= Ref & PublishedGameboard
		- transitions of skil/standards info from user_copy -- ref -- gameboard_search
									 						\_ ediÃ·ions 
		- Gameboard: no change besides that skills' names go into 'category' for search
		- Ref: skill_tags in 'metadata' 
			-> I had set this up already
			-> used in project-details and skills-browser

Ripple effects: 
	= Skill-tagger
			- tagging standards from skills
			- major change in standard tagging
			- UI stays the same

	= Standard browser
	= Search
	= Interactive: Teacher's guides

Transition (we did not talk about this):
	1. insert skills to all master User Copy right now, keep skills.
	2. curriculum team will start tagging skills on Hiro's staging-app (or even prod app).
	
	-- as long as the changes only affect master user copies and no new master/edition is published,
	  no effect on user experiences

	Q: What to do with state standards
		- we will see how fast skill tagging and skill-standard matching happen

	Q: Should I use staging app?
		- changes can be made only to author-facing features


-------

E-team
	- Skill schema
		- current design. Standard docs have skill_ids
		- when added to the item, skill is added additional fields (names, excluded_skills, etc...)
		- do something similar with skills (skill gets additional fields when added to items)

	- UserCopy schema

	- Ref / PublishedGameboard schema
		- no need to change too much, and I don't want to touch gameboards_search collection docs
		- make it work so taht little change to current metadata
		- keep existing standards info

	- How to transition to the new schema
		- DB migraiton -> test collection?
		- co-existing of standards and skills, make one-time change
		- using staging app for skill-tagging while public app doesn't change.




what to do with current users' copies?
	- we don't want to make it backward compatible => we would need to change lessons onwed by users
	- curriculum has to tag with skills without chagning questions first?
	- what about old versions? we can't go back to every edition to tag with skills

	- old users would lose access to the features that rely on standard
	- they are prompted to download newer versions.

Ref & Gameboard's schema is changing
	- check in with Ashley

Transition model?
	- standards and skills co-exist in lesson item?
