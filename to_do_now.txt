** Skill Tagger **
Phase 1
	goal: 
		- curriculum team is able to start tagging skills
		- no impact to user facing feature
	x check skill functionality in lesson-details page
	x include 'focus_skill' field in gameboard_serach.skill_tags (set this up in models)
	
	x edit lesson-details page to accomodate new skill structure
	
	x auto-exclude unwanted grade during skill insertion to user_copy docs

	x standard description
	x have standards show up in item section

	x for now, setup standard-retrieval from skills, then disable it for now
	x teacher's guided

	x how to have standards from skills and old skills coexist in terms of teacher view?
		- author cannot edit state standards any more.
		- CCSS should be sync'ed with what author does.
		- we don't want to keep 'standards' field when standard-tagging is complete

		A: 
			- When needed in front end, CCSS standards are generated from skills
			- Old CCSS still exists in document, but won't be used

		B:
			- New tagging does not sync, meaning item will display old standards

		C: 
			- When CCSS are changed by the author, it override existing CCSS standards in 'stanards' field
			- fewer places to re-write code
	     => C.a: do this in backend script
	     		- I would have a better control of data. Not having to track down what's happened in front-end.
			C.b: do this in real-time in frontend

	x edit take_snapshot to quarantine skills in master usercopy

	x disable skill browser
	
	x finish writing scripts to insert skills (gather all active master user_copies)
	
	X adjust tag-skills browser based on Q to Erin.
	
	x check diffs and refactor code.
		- use set instead of list (js)
		- computed to pureComputed (js)
		- call observable only once per function

	x make tag-skills-modal universal for Ashley's compo

	x identify and remove unused routes related to skills
	
	- re-import, do all the manual tests
	
	x document the process and expectations

Between Phases
	- write a script to override standards with skills' standards
	- insert new standard (non-ccss) mapping

Phase 2
	goal: taggled skills will take effect.

	- propagate changes in master usercopy to its children edition usercopies
	- check functions in skills browser
	- pdg generation
	- project_details UI (display of skills)
	- test the process from item tagging all the way to gameboard_search (it's been tested. just do it again)

Unleash when all skills are tagged
	-- pacerrabbit --
	+ ItemWithSkills
		__standard_by_category => __standard_by_category_new
		== displayed standards for the item to sync'ed with new tagging feature

	+ TeacherGuideSection
		item_with_standards.standards =>  .__computed_standards
		== standard table

	+ Skills Browser in browse-by-standard.html

	-- models -- 	
	+ models.ResourceWithItems.get_all_standard_ids
		enable commented-out code
		== for teacher-guide section

	+ models.RefAsGameboard
		gather skill info from metadata and transfer to PublishedGameboard as 'categories'
		__init__ and construct_tags (switch between old code and new code)

	+ models.InteractiveResourceUserCopy.take_snapshot
		__remove_all_skills

	+ models.RefAsGameboard.__init__
		uncomment 'skill_tags' in lesson_details_field

	+ models.Gameboard.get_standards()
		comment out if self.has_interactive_version() clause to draw updated standards

Suggestions
	- consider organizing standards' subject naming
	- in interactive resources, get standard descriptions only once
		now it does at least twice(initial load, and tag-skills modal)

	- update of usercopy edition happen in views.py. => should be in the model


When a state standard is tagged with skill,
	- automatically add state standards to existing usercopy.items.skills
	- the standard info sync in Ref.combined_tags and PublishedGameboard.categories


Issues:
	- author views items donn't show standard's description on hover if the standards hadn't been a part of the lesson already. (b/c server grabs only descriptions of existing standards)

** Other Tasks **

= Write more tests
	- UserCopy.set/unset_confidence_score_questions
	- HierarchicalTag.get_all_as_tree()
	- get_all_skills_w_standards()
	- has_purchased_lessons / has_payment_record / get_disabled_lessons

= Heroku Migration
	push to main app

= npm migration
	- ignore exportsOverride in bower.json and migrate just dependencies (we don't know what they are)

	- Grunt -> standard browser, project platform page
	- migrating to gulp is a huge task for standard browser


= Metrics (on hold)
	1. admin-page:
		- Do this fist to make it easy to test the above feature
		- Peruse: edit users' district_admin status
		- district_access, and site_access_flag
			- let the user see all users' info within the district
		- 
		
		Add to User document
			- district_admin_user: T/F
			- district_access: T/F
			- district_access: T/F

		:w


	2. my-nextlesson page:
		- add 'district_admin' flag to user doc
			- make it editable in nl admin page
		- set is_district_admin func much like is_teacher
		- insert link for drop down menu
		- insert an object in my-apps.js that mirrors other comp
		  i.e. my-lessons & my-classes
	
		
	3. add page metrics to track usage
	Access Denied page(403):
		- Any current 403 page?

	Build district_dashboard page
