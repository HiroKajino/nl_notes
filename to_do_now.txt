== meeting with Erin
	What's done:
		Show user activity
			-> number of participants & submissions are not filtered by the date
		Original Column
		checkmark instead of yes/no
		Emailer is ready (wait til new school year?)

		Fixes:
			Edge, check fn of 'custom date'

	Questions & Concerns:
		To show warning that the table data is outside of licence duration, the license date has to be correct.
			For example, Dublin's license start date is summer 2016 thought they have usage record before that.

		Suggested new tasks:
			Maybe Downloaded AND Used Lessons Modal instead of just Download?
				More accurate usage information on what's actually being used online. Include old lessons.
				Include original lessons, too.
		
				Show all lessons owned by the teacher and accessed by anyone (teacher or students) 
				show same info with 'last used date' instead of 'download_date'

			Consult with E-team:
				Change Download Tracking to track user_copy id in addition to gid, ref, and edition_v id
				Is there a reason why 'Making Another Copy' creates a new record but cloning doesn't? 
				Consolidate the same id downloads, remove later download dates
				

	FYI:
		I don't know how other interactive platform DB schema/model are written. This might create a need for adjustment
		after Ashley/Duy are done with their projects. 


Admin Dashboard Q's
	Dowload relavent but it's not the as accurate of measure as usage data. 

	Download Tracking
		- Should we get rid of redundancy (remove duplicates download records)?
			We should not record the download when 'Make Another Copy' is pressed(when the same lesson is dl'ed)
			It's creating inconsistency b/c when a lesson clone is made, it's not recorded as donwload.
		- Alternatively, record all creations of copies
		
		- When new lessons come live, what happens?
			interactive worksheet
			interactive projects

	What changes are made to all the lessons that affects Admin Dashboard and download tracking?


why no edition info for 'Mmm Mmm Bakery'
	users download paperversion of the lesson, which doesn't have editions
	interactive editions are created
	user never logged in to NL
	no interactive rec user copy is created and only paper one exists, but show up as 'interactive' true, because
		'has_interactive_version' flag is true
	one such user is pottsj1 in Maury
	participants info should not matter since paper pt was worksheet


Q to Duy/Eng. Team
	'Make Another Copy' will create a new record in dl tracking, but creating new copy from platform doesn't
	What happens when paper pt had been downloaded, and the user now access the old lesson?
		-> how does it affect download tracking, if at all?

== Admin Dashboard ==
	
	User Settings:
		Anyone with dashboard access can change info of non-teacher users
		if you have site access, no option to flag/unflag district access
		Remove user type in user settings
		Add a paragraph to explain what user settings do
		Sort users by districts

	Custom Active:
		include all columns in Activity section

	Settings UI:
		Make tables align
		'Update' button to the right
		make 'Account Info' and 'Settings' don't stack

	Documentation
		Add code_review_script documentation to the js file

=Future Admin Dashboard=
	Able to see all teachers within the district (UI is concern, but open up for employess)
	Account Info for Employees
	Add email address of the teachers in the downloaded csv table


	Teacher downloads list
		loading logo
		sortable by column(transplant from admin-dashboard)
		link to the lesson on click

	Find where the NL header is. Some pages don't have the link to admin-dashboard.

	Add participants info
		interactive pt
		gameboard 


	Higher priority--
		When opening dl-history-modal for the same user, don't reset variables.

		UI:
			yes/no on 'interactive'
			show dl type like downloads table
			grade & subject singular in dl history details
			take off line on expanded table row in dl-history

		auto save settings
		More edits to Admin Dashboard:
			Close button white in modal in white

		Pending Users:
			when pending users has the admin access flag, preserve it when it becomes a active account
		More edits:
			Loading logo while switching sections:
				checkout admin-dashboard branch --> even when 'finished_loading_table_data()' is false, 
				spinner doesn't kick in.

		When the specified timeframe is outside of district license, show message (for expired districts)
			-> hasn't been deployed

		Check on Edge browser

		Admin Dashboard Emailer
			user has a flag 'recieves_admin_dashboard_email_alert': T/F
			flag 'frequency': every_week, every_month, every_2_month, every_3_month
			'last_received'
			'See last months activity in your district'
				as default, link to show last month activity

	Activity Modal instead of Download history
		model method get_used_or_downloaded_lessons created
		fixing download-history route
		original lesson column
			Jorge Albarran ==> original flags to be true
			google_user_116832471028620047361 | Fairfield-Suisun USD Public Safety Academy 

			Katherine McKenna ==> original flags to be false (2015-16 year)
			google_user_112215999174643378653 | Green Valley Middle School | katherinem@fsusd.org

	Check Edge function on 'custom date'
	Set up Email Sender 

	Test Email
	don't set on scheduler email yet -> wa


get-userinfo-modal
	- the 'force-update-date' is set in my-nextlesson.es6
	- it makes the user update grades, subjects, and standards
	- TODO: change text depending on whether user has never entered info / needs updates
	- Q: What about district info? What about the role?


<Start Here>
Talk to Duy:
	Google Email linking
		- remove the clause `if exiting_users_with_same_email:`?
		- on first time goolge signin, has to query API twice b/c 
		  first query doesn't give refresh token. Is there a reason why
		  `access_type=offline` flag is not always used?
		- is it okay to flag `google_user` as token comes in?

		- next is to make existing google user creates username and password?

	Lower priority--

		Add Sentry error to client code?
		When signing as 'Admin', straight to Admin Dashboard
		real time activity feed in the page

		Put site_metrics_module_cache script into worker queue instead of running it on Heroku Scheduler

		Try solving the issue of duplicates

		Refactor:
			MARK2: Consider consolidating this with set_initial_district_and_school_ids
			Consider description pop ups into a component or templates

		Performance improvement
			localStorage(frontend)
			cache by district (backend)
		
	With E-team
		Consolidate duplicate teachers with different email addresses
		Fix Pending user number


== standard-to-skill-migration ==
Discussion on Skill Browser button sizes and tag length. -> save this for future when we have a data. 
	- 20%, 30%, 45% 


** Skill Tagger **
Phase 1
	goal: 
		- curriculum team is able to start tagging skills
		- no impact to user facing feature
	x check skill functionality in lesson-details page
	x include 'focus_skill' field in gameboard_serach.skill_tags (set this up in models)
	
	x edit lesson-details page to accomodate new skill structure
	
	x auto-exclude unwanted grade during skill insertion to user_copy docs

	x standard description
	x have standards show up in item section

	x for now, setup standard-retrieval from skills, then disable it for now
	x teacher's guided

	x how to have standards from skills and old skills coexist in terms of teacher view?
		- author cannot edit state standards any more.
		- CCSS should be sync'ed with what author does.
		- we don't want to keep 'standards' field when standard-tagging is complete

		A: 
			- When needed in front end, CCSS standards are generated from skills
			- Old CCSS still exists in document, but won't be used

		B:
			- New tagging does not sync, meaning item will display old standards

		C: 
			- When CCSS are changed by the author, it override existing CCSS standards in 'stanards' field
			- fewer places to re-write code
	     => C.a: do this in backend script
	     		- I would have a better control of data. Not having to track down what's happened in front-end.
			C.b: do this in real-time in frontend

	x edit take_snapshot to quarantine skills in master usercopy

	x disable skill browser
	
	x finish writing scripts to insert skills (gather all active master user_copies)
	
	X adjust tag-skills browser based on Q to Erin.
	
	x check diffs and refactor code.
		- use set instead of list (js)
		- computed to pureComputed (js)
		- call observable only once per function

	x make tag-skills-modal universal for Ashley's compo

	x identify and remove unused routes related to skills
	
	- re-import, do all the manual tests
	
	x document the process and expectations

Between Phases
	- write a script to override standards with skills' standards
	- insert new standard (non-ccss) mapping

Phase 2
	goal: taggled skills will take effect.

	- propagate changes in master usercopy to its children edition usercopies
	- check functions in skills browser
	- pdg generation
	- project_details UI (display of skills)
	- test the process from item tagging all the way to gameboard_search (it's been tested. just do it again)

	- change front end logic to display standards. Now standards only carry '_id' and 'grade'. This is a new change,
	  and no work has been done to accomodate this.

Unleash when all skills are tagged
	-- pacerrabbit --
	+ ItemWithSkills
		__standard_by_category => __standard_by_category_new
		== displayed standards for the item to sync'ed with new tagging feature

	+ TeacherGuideSection
		item_with_standards.standards =>  .__computed_standards
		== standard table

	+ Skills Browser in browse-by-standard.html

	-- models -- 	
	+ models.ResourceWithItems.get_all_standard_ids
		enable commented-out code
		== for teacher-guide section

	+ models.RefAsGameboard
		gather skill info from metadata and transfer to PublishedGameboard as 'categories'
		__init__ and construct_tags (switch between old code and new code)

	+ models.InteractiveResourceUserCopy.take_snapshot
		__remove_all_skills

	+ models.RefAsGameboard.__init__
		uncomment 'skill_tags' in lesson_details_field

	+ models.Gameboard.get_standards()
		comment out if self.has_interactive_version() clause to draw updated standards

Suggestions
	- consider organizing standards' subject naming
	- in interactive resources, get standard descriptions only once
		now it does at least twice(initial load, and tag-skills modal)

	- update of usercopy edition happen in views.py. => should be in the model


When a state standard is tagged with skill,
	- automatically add state standards to existing usercopy.items.skills
	- the standard info sync in Ref.combined_tags and PublishedGameboard.categories


Issues:
	- author views items donn't show standard's description on hover if the standards hadn't been a part of the lesson already. (b/c server grabs only descriptions of existing standards)


** Other Tasks **

= Write more tests
	- UserCopy.set/unset_confidence_score_questions
	- HierarchicalTag.get_all_as_tree()
	- get_all_skills_w_standards()
	- has_purchased_lessons / has_payment_record / get_disabled_lessons


= ConfidenceScore
	ConfidenceScore, instead of username, show student's actual name
	change 'vision' to 'Real World Connection'

= npm migration
	- ignore exportsOverride in bower.json and migrate just dependencies (we don't know what they are)

	- Grunt -> standard browser, project platform page
	- migrating to gulp is a huge task for standard browser
